- Example: 500 paid users × 20% × $10 = $1,000 MRR

---

### 2. One-Time Credit Packs (Pay-As-You-Go)
**Strategy:** Serve occasional users who don't want subscriptions

**Pricing:**
- 50 images: $9.99 (never expires)
- 200 images: $29.99
- 500 images: $59.99

**Target:**

**Pricing for Shopify App:**
- Free: 50 images/month
- Starter: $19/month (matches Shopify app pricing norms)

## Pricing Psychology & Optimization

### Why These Price Points?

**$9 Starter:**
- Psychological barrier: Under $10 = impulse purchase
- Coffee test: "Less than 2 coffees/month"
- Low enough for trial, high enough to value

**$29 Pro:**
- Sweet spot: Not too cheap (quality signal), not too expensive
- 3x Starter = clear value jump
- Anchors to competitor mid-tiers ($24-34/month market standard)

**$99 Business:**
- Just under $100 psychological threshold
- Business expense justification (<$100/month easy approvals)
- 3.4x Pro = encourages Pro for most users (revenue optimization)

### Pricing Experiments to Test

**A/B Test 1: Annual Discount**
- Control: 17% discount (2 months free)
- Test: 20% discount vs 25% discount
- Hypothesis: Larger discount increases annual uptake, improving cash flow and retention

**A/B Test 2: Usage-Based vs Unlimited**
- Control: Credit-based limits
- Test: "Unlimited" tier at $39/month (with fair-use policy)
- Hypothesis: "Unlimited" reduces decision friction, increases conversions

**A/B Test 3: Free Tier Limits**
- Control: 10 images/month
- Test A: 5 images/month (scarcity)
- Test B: 20 images/month (generosity)
- Hypothesis: Test impact on free-to-paid conversion rate

**A/B Test 4: Add-On Bundling**
- Control: Separate add-ons
- Test: "Pro Plus" bundle ($39/month with face enhancement + extended storage)
- Hypothesis: Bundling increases perceived value and ARPU

## Pricing Optimization Experiments

### Continuous Improvement

**Monthly Reviews:**

---

## Risk Mitigation: Revenue Protection

### Risk 1: API Price Increases (Replicate raises prices)
**Mitigation:**
- Multi-provider strategy (add Stability AI, Hugging Face as backups)
- Self-hosting evaluation at 100k+ images/month
- Price increase clause in ToS (can pass costs to customers)

### Risk 2: High Churn Rates
**Mitigation:**
- Onboarding optimization (ensure users see value)
- Customer success outreach (proactive support for high-value accounts)
- Annual plans (lock in for 12 months)
- Feature development based on retention data

### Risk 3: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test free tier limits
- Improve upgrade messaging and triggers
- Add high-value features to paid tiers
- Customer interviews to understand barriers

### Risk 4: Price Sensitivity / Competitors Undercut
**Mitigation:**
- Differentiation through unique features (text preservation)
- Value-based pricing (ROI calculator)
- Bundle add-ons for higher perceived value
- Focus on business users (higher WTP than consumers)
