# Value Propositions - AI Image Enhancer & Upscaler

## Core Positioning Statement

**"Professional image enhancement and upscaling for businesses—in seconds, not hours, with text and logos that stay sharp."**

## The Dual Value Proposition

### 1. Image Enhancement (Primary Market: 40.5k searches/month)
**What it means:** AI-powered quality improvement without changing resolution
- Sharpen blurry details
- Remove noise and artifacts
- Enhance colors and brightness
- Improve contrast and clarity
- Fix under/overexposed photos

### 2. Image Upscaling (Secondary Market: 27k searches/month)
**What it means:** Increase resolution without quality loss
- 2x, 4x, 8x resolution multiplier
- Maintain sharpness when enlarging
- Generate missing detail intelligently
- Prepare for print or high-res displays
- Meet marketplace resolution requirements

### 3. Combined Power (Our Differentiation)
**What competitors don't do:**
- Most tools do EITHER enhancement OR upscaling
- We do BOTH in one workflow
- Users don't need multiple tools
- Consistent results across both operations
