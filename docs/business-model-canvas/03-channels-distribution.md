## Distribution Channel FAQs

**Q: Why so much SEO focus vs paid ads?**
A: SEO has 10:1 long-term ROI in this market, competitors prove it works, and high CPC makes paid expensive. SEO compounds, paid doesn't.

**Q: Won't freemium cannibalize paid plans?**
A: No—successful SaaS like Let's Enhance use freemium. Free tier creates awareness and trust. Only 3-5% convert, which is expected and profitable.

**Q: Why Shopify before WooCommerce?**
A: Shopify merchants have higher income, better conversion rates, and app store provides built-in distribution. WooCommerce is phase 2.

**Q: How do we compete with free tools for SEO?**
A: We're not free—we're "freemium professional." Target business users willing to pay for reliability, speed, and text preservation. Different buyer.

**Q: What if paid ads don't work?**
A: That's why we test small first. If CPA >$300 and LTV <$400, we cut budget and reallocate to SEO/PLG. Flexibility is key.
