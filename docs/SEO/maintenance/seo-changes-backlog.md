# SEO Changes Backlog

Purpose: keep a concise operational trail of SEO changes so future audits can connect ranking, indexing, CTR, and attribution movement to actual site changes.

Maintenance rules:

- Add an entry every time SEO-facing code, metadata, content, sitemap, schema, canonical, hreflang, robots, redirects, IndexNow, GSC, GA4 attribution, pSEO data, or blog SEO changes.
- Keep entries short: what changed, why, files/surfaces touched, validation, and follow-up.
- If this file gets large, summarize older detailed entries into a monthly rollup and keep only recent operational detail.
- Link related reports, PRDs, or follow-up backlog files instead of pasting long analysis.

## Open Follow-Ups

- [ ] After next deploy, complete [GSC request indexing backlog](./gsc-request-indexing-backlog.md).
- [ ] After next deploy, verify `https://myimageupscaler.com/sitemap-static.xml` includes `/de`, `/es`, `/fr`, `/it`, `/ja`, and `/pt`.
- [ ] After next deploy, re-inspect `https://myimageupscaler.com/it` in GSC and confirm it now has a referring sitemap.

### SEO Next Steps Execution: Batch 1 CTR Refresh, Attribution, Sitemap

Source: [seo-next-steps-2026-05-05.md](../reports/seo-next-steps-2026-05-05.md)

Changes:

- Refreshed 5 database-backed blog posts with Three Kings updates: title/SEO title, H1, and first paragraph.
- Added featured-snippet support to `ai-image-upscaling-vs-sharpening-explained`: answer block, comparison table, FAQ, and internal tool links.
- Added first-touch attribution fields to client analytics events so high-intent events retain source context after redirects.
- Mapped `upscale_completed` to GA4 `generate_lead`.
- Added non-English locale homepages to `sitemap-static.xml`, including `/it`.
- Created [GSC request indexing backlog](./gsc-request-indexing-backlog.md).

Validation:

- Focused tests passed: `tests/unit/seo/seo-next-steps-blog-refresh.unit.spec.ts`, `tests/unit/seo/homepage-locale-links.unit.spec.ts`, `tests/unit/analytics/analytics-fixes.unit.spec.ts`.
- `yarn verify` passed with existing warnings.
- IndexNow accepted 6 URLs.
- Search Console API sitemap resubmission succeeded with `204`.
- GSC URL Inspection API showed the 5 refreshed blog posts as `Submitted and indexed`.
- GSC URL Inspection API showed `/it` as indexed but with no referring sitemap before deploy.

Follow-up:

- Manually request indexing in GSC after deploy for URLs in [GSC request indexing backlog](./gsc-request-indexing-backlog.md).
- Confirm `/it` gets sitemap association after deploy.
