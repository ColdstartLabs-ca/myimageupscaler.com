# Competitor Sitemap Intelligence: upscale.media

**Analyzed**: 2026-02-11
**Total URLs found**: ~66 in sitemap (3 base pages x 22 languages) + 191+ orphaned pSEO pages still live
**Sitemap structure**: Single sitemap, dramatically pruned from 403 pages (Jan 2026) to 3 base pages

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: Massive Sitemap Pruning

Since our last analysis (Jan 6, 2026), upscale.media has **removed ~97% of their pages from their sitemap**. Their XML sitemap now contains only 3 base paths:

| Base Path | Description | Language Variants |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/` | Homepage | 22 |
| `/upload` | Main upscaling tool | 22 |
| `/video-upscale` | Video upscaler (NEW) | 22 |

**However**: All 191+ /tools/, /product/, and /blog/ pages are **still live** (HTTP 200). They've been de-indexed from the sitemap but remain accessible.

### Possible Explanations

1. **SEO pivot**: They may be consolidating authority on fewer pages to boost rankings for core terms
2. **Thin content cleanup**: Google may have penalized their thin pSEO pages
3. **Technical oversight**: Sitemap generation bug during a migration
4. **Intentional de-indexing**: They may be using noindex on these pages now (we can't confirm)

**Strategic Implication**: If they're abandoning 191+ pages worth of long-tail keywords, this is a **massive opportunity window** for us to capture those rankings.

- **Capabilities**: HD, Full HD, and 4K upscaling
- **Formats**: MP4, MOV, WebM

## Updated Pricing Intelligence

Their pricing has evolved (now in CAD):

| Plan | Credits/Month | Price (CAD/mo) | Cost/Credit |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Free | 1 credit | $0 | - |
| 100 Credits | 100 | $6.99 | $0.07 |

- Add-on packages: 50-1,000 credits ($7.99-$84.99)

---

## Content Strategy Summary

**What they're doing well:**
1. **22-language internationalization** - Massive locale coverage (hi, id, pt, es, de, it, fr, zh, ru, th, hu, vi, ms, pl, ja, ko, tr, uk, bn, nl, el)
2. **Video upscaling** - New product vertical we don't have
3. **Comprehensive content depth** - 3,000-4,000 words per product page with step-by-step guides and top-10 lists
4. **Cross-product promotion** - Heavy internal linking to PixelBin ecosystem products
5. **FAQPage schema** - Present on tool pages
6. **Social proof** - Testimonial carousels on every page

**Their weaknesses:**
1. **Sitemap pruning** - Removed 97% of pages from sitemap; if intentional, they're abandoning long-tail SEO
2. **Thin content pattern** - Despite word count, ~70% of content is templated/swapped keywords
3. **Typo in H1** - "Stable Defusion" (sic) on their stable-diffusion page - quality control issues
4. **No structured data beyond FAQ** - Missing SoftwareApplication, HowTo, Article schemas
5. **Generic testimonials** - Same testimonials across pages (not page-specific)
6. **Heavy PixelBin branding** - Dilutes upscale.media brand authority

## Traffic Estimation

### Their Current Vulnerability

With their sitemap pruned to 3 pages, Google may be:
1. **De-indexing** their 191+ orphaned pages over time
2. **Reducing crawl frequency** on pages not in sitemap
3. **Losing rankings** on long-tail keywords those pages targeted

### Keyword Volume Analysis (from our keywords.csv)

| Keyword Cluster | Monthly Searches | Competition | Our Position | Their Position |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| "image upscaler" | 500,000 | Low | ~108 | Top 10 |
| "ai image upscaler" | 500,000 | Low | ~116 | Top 10 |
| "ai photo enhancer" | 500,000 | Low | N/A | Top 10 |
| "photo quality enhancer" | 500,000 | Low | N/A | Top 10 |
| "upscale image to 4k" | 50,000 | Low | N/A | Top 10 |
| "free image upscaler" | 50,000 | Low | ~156 | Top 10 |
| "midjourney upscaler" | 5,000+ | Low | N/A | Top 20 |
| "video upscaler" | 50,000+ (est.) | Low-Med | None | In sitemap |

**Reality check**: We're currently at avg position 57 with 13 clicks/28 days. They likely get 50,000-200,000+ monthly organic visits. The gap is enormous but closing as we scale our pSEO.

## Traffic Steal Battle Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
Capitalize on their sitemap pruning. Pages we can create/optimize immediately.

| Action | Target Keywords | Est. Monthly Searches | Effort |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| Populate ai-features.json (currently 0 pages) | "ai clarity enhancer", "ai noise reduction", "ai face enhancement" | 50,000+ combined | Low - data file only |
| Add quality-enhancement pSEO pages to tools or new category | "clear image quality", "make photo hd", "improve image resolution" | 100,000+ combined | Medium - new data file |
| Optimize existing free.json pages for head terms | "free image upscaler", "free ai upscaler", "free photo enhancer" | 150,000+ combined | Low - content updates |
| Add 5+ blog posts targeting their top blog keywords | "best midjourney upscaling tools", "best ai image upscaler 2026" | 20,000+ combined | Medium - content creation |

**Phase 1 Est. New Pages**: 25-30
**Phase 1 Est. Traffic Capture**: 2,000-5,000 monthly visits (within 3-6 months)

### Phase 2: Content Expansion (2-4 weeks)
Build out categories that directly compete with their abandoned pages.

| Action | Target Keywords | Est. Monthly Searches | Effort |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| Create "quality enhancement" pSEO category (15 pages) | "enhance photo quality", "increase image clarity", "fix pixelated image", "low quality to high quality" | 200,000+ combined | Medium - new category |
| Expand blog to 30+ posts on core topics | Informational upscaling queries | 50,000+ combined | High - content creation |
| Add "best tools" comparison/roundup pages | "best image upscaler 2026", "best free upscaling tools" | 30,000+ combined | Medium |
| Create video upscaling landing page (even if tool isn't ready) | "video upscaler", "upscale video to 4k" | 50,000+ combined | Low (landing page only) |

**Phase 2 Est. New Pages**: 50+
**Phase 2 Est. Traffic Capture**: 5,000-15,000 monthly visits (within 6 months)

### Phase 3: Strategic Moves (1-3 months)
Bigger initiatives for sustained competitive advantage.

| Action | Target Keywords | Est. Monthly Searches | Effort |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| Add 5+ new languages (es, fr, de, pt, ja) for top-performing pSEO pages | All localized variants | 500,000+ combined (all langs) | Very High |

**Phase 3 Est. New Pages**: 100+
**Phase 3 Est. Traffic Capture**: 20,000-50,000 monthly visits (within 12 months)

---

## Estimated Traffic Capture

| Phase | New Pages | Est. Monthly Traffic | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| Quick Wins | 25-30 | 2,000-5,000 | 1-2 weeks to ship, 3-6 months to rank |
| Expansion | 50+ | 5,000-15,000 | 2-4 weeks to ship, 6 months to rank |
| Strategic | 100+ | 20,000-50,000 | 1-3 months to ship, 12 months to rank |
| **Total** | **175+** | **27,000-70,000** | |

*Note: These estimates assume average CTR of 2-5% at page 1 rankings. Given our current avg position of 57, ranking improvements are the bottleneck, not page creation.*

---

## Recommendations

1. **Highest priority**: **Populate ai-features.json** immediately. This is a 0-page category we already have infrastructure for. Upscale.media has 15+ pages here that may lose rankings due to sitemap removal. Fill the vacuum.

2. **Create a "quality enhancement" pSEO category** with 15-20 pages targeting "improve image quality", "make photo hd", "clear blurry image", etc. These are extremely high-volume keywords (500K+ monthly searches in aggregate) and upscale.media's pages are orphaned from their sitemap.

3. **Don't chase video upscaling yet** as a product feature (high engineering cost), but **DO create a landing page** targeting "video upscaler" keywords to start building topical authority. Link to a waitlist or blog post about video upscaling best practices.

4. **Focus on backlinks and domain authority** over more pSEO pages. With 280 pages and avg position 57, our bottleneck is domain authority, not content volume. Even 50 pages ranking at position 10 would drive more traffic than 500 pages at position 57.

5. **Monitor their sitemap weekly**. If they're in the process of a migration or intentionally pruning, their rankings on long-tail keywords will drop over the next 2-3 months. This is our window.

6. **Leverage our multiplier strategy advantage**. We have 175+ page types they completely lack (camera-raw, format-scale, platform-format, device-use, etc.). These won't drive traffic until we rank, but they build topical depth that helps our core pages rank higher.
