## Long description (50-500 words)

MyImageUpscaler is an AI-powered image enhancement platform designed to upscale images while maintaining visual integrity. The service supports resolution scaling from 2x to 16x, with specialized AI models optimized for different image types including portraits, landscapes, and graphics-heavy content.

A key focus of the platform is text and logo preservation during upscaling—a common pain point with similar tools that often render text blurry or unreadable. The system automatically detects image content and selects the most appropriate AI model, whether that's face restoration algorithms for portraits or detail-focused models for general photos.

The platform offers six quality tiers ranging from basic 2x upscaling to advanced 8x enhancement. Users can process single images or batch up to 500 images at once, making it suitable for both individual creators and professional workflows. Output formats include JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, and BMP, with options to convert to specific resolutions like HD, 2K, 4K, or 8K.

The freemium model provides initial credits for testing, while paid subscriptions and credit packs accommodate varying usage levels. Subscription credits roll over month-to-month as long as the account remains active. The service operates without watermarks on processed images, making it viable for commercial and print applications.

Technical infrastructure runs on Cloudflare Workers for global performance, with authentication and data management handled through Supabase. The platform emphasizes accurate scale reporting—users receive actual dimension data to verify upscaling results.

## How is this tool unique or different?

Most AI image upscalers struggle with text and logos—characters become blurry, edges lose definition, and business graphics turn into indistinct shapes. MyImageUpscaler addresses this specifically through specialized AI pathways that preserve text clarity even at 4x or higher scaling factors.

The platform uses smart model selection rather than applying one-size-fits-all processing. A portrait triggers GFPGAN face restoration, while a landscape gets Real-ESRGAN treatment, and enhancement-only needs use Flux-2-Pro. This targeted approach produces more natural results without the artificial over-processing common in competitors.

Transparency sets the service apart: the API returns actual output dimensions so users can verify the claimed scale factor actually occurred, rather than trusting vague enhancement claims.

Unlike many alternatives, processed images carry no watermarks and are suitable for commercial use. Batch processing supports up to 500 simultaneous images, accommodating professional workflows that consumer tools can't handle. The service is fully operational now—no waiting lists or closed betas.
