### First Comment

```
Hey PH!

I built MyImageUpscaler because I couldn't find anything that was both fast and affordable for bulk image upscaling.

If you're an e-commerce seller with 500 product photos, most tools will either take hours to process or cost hundreds of dollars. That didn't make sense to me.

MyImageUpscaler does 2x and 4x upscaling in under 10 seconds per image. The real benefit is batch processing: upload 500 images at once and they're done while you grab lunch.

**What it does:**
- 2x and 4x upscaling, under 10 seconds each
- Batch upload up to 500 images
- Presets for Amazon, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok
- No watermarks
- Credits roll over on paid plans

**Who it's for:**
- E-commerce sellers with lots of product photos
- Content creators resizing for different platforms
- Real estate agents
- Photographers delivering to clients

Free tier is 10 credits, no card required. Paid plans start at $9/month.

Check it out and let me know what you think. Happy to answer questions.
