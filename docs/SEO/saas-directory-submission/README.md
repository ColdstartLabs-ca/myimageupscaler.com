## Unique Value Proposition

**MyImageUpscaler is the only AI image upscaler with Text Preservation Mode**—keeping product labels, logos, and text perfectly sharp during enhancement.

Other upscalers blur text; we protect it. This makes us the essential choice for:

- E-commerce sellers (product labels must be readable)
- Real estate agents (property addresses, listing details)
- Content creators (branded images)
- Anyone upscaling images with text

## Directory Submission Tips

1. **Use consistent branding** across all submissions
2. **Choose appropriate categories** for each directory
3. **Tailor descriptions** to character limits (use alternatives provided)
4. **Include relevant screenshots** showing the product in action
5. **Track submissions** to avoid duplicates
6. **Monitor for approval** and respond to follow-up requests

## Key Differentiators to Highlight

When submitting, emphasize these unique points:

1. **Text Preservation Mode** - No competitor offers this
2. **Speed** - Under 10 seconds processing
3. **No watermarks on free tier** - Unlike Let's Enhance, Pixelcut
4. **Monthly billing** - Unlike annual-only competitors
5. **Business-focused** - Not for artists/generative AI users
