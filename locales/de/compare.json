          "question": "Is AI upscaling better than traditional resizing?",

        {
          "question": "Will upscaled images look fake or over-processed?",
          "answer": "Quality AI upscalers produce natural-looking results. Over-processing is more common with lower-quality tools or extreme upscaling factors (8x+) on very small source images."
